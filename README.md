# Beer-Tracks

## Elevator Pitch

Have you ever wondered how much beer you drink or how much that beer is costing you? This will give you the cold, delicious truth.

## Project Requirements

  * Simple Feature Set
  * CRUD - Create, Read, Edit, Delete Data
  * Prints out a consumption/expense report with astounding facts

## Feature List:

   * I can enter information from my daily intake journal such as receipts: Beer Oz. Consumed, Calories, Price.
   * I can Update and delete records.
   * I can query for my intake or expense for a given day or week.
   * I can look at the full list of beers I drank.
   * I can calculate how much i pay per ABV.

## Interesting Query:

Perhaps I should print out how much money I would have saved and how many calories I would have avoided had I just drank water.

## Data Source:

ABV Data from http://www.brewerydb.com/developers

Enter my own receipts for pricing.
I will determine an approximate calorie intake based on the average calorie in an oz. of beer. BreweryDB doesn't list calories.
