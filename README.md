# Beer-Tracks

## Elevator Pitch

Have you ever wondered how much beer you drink or how much that beer is costing you? This will give you the cold, delicious truth.

## Project Requirements

  * Simple Feature Set
  * CRUD - Create, Read, Edit, Delete Data
  * Prints out a consumption/expense report with astounding facts

## Feature List:

   * I can enter information from my daily intake journal such as receipts: Beer Oz. Consumed, Calories, Price, Where Beer was Purchased
   * I can query for my average intake or expense for a given day, the total for the week, or how many calories consumed in beer.
   * I can look at the full list of beers I drank.
   * I can get a report of how much money I spent and how much fatter I am. On an average day or a total for the week.

## Interesting Query:

Perhaps I should print out how much money I would have saved and how many calories I would have avoided had I just drank water.

## Data Source:

ABV Data from http://www.brewerydb.com/developers

Enter my own receipts for pricing.
